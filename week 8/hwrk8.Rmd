## P1

## P2

### 1.
-   First, The expectation,and thus its plug-in estimator, the mean, of a binary variable is just its probability. So:
-   $\mu_1=E[Y|W=1] = P(Y|W=1)$
-   From here we can use this conditional probability identity:
-   $P(Y|W=1) = \frac{P(W=1,Y)}{P(W=1)}$
- Since we already defined for binary variables Y and W that their probabilities equal their expected values we arrive at:
-   $E[Y|W=1] = \frac{E[WY]}{E[W]}$
-   Using plug in estimators for the expectations we arrive at:
-   $ = \frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}WY}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}W}$
