# LAB

joint pdf -> integrate with respect to one var = marginal prob of that one var (reg 1D PDF) -> integrate again -> get probability (total is one)

spec joint probs with definite double integrals to return probability:

$P(0<X<3, 3<Y<4) =\int_{3}^{0} f_{x,y}(x,y) \,dx$ *double integral*

$f_{x|y} = f_{x,y}(x,y)/f_y(y)$

```{r}
data <- expand_grid(w1 = seq(0,1,length = 1000),
                    w2 = seq(0,1,length = 1000)) %>% 
  mutate(
    X = sin(2*pi*w)
  )


              
```


transforming RVs change their distribution (e.g. multiplying)
