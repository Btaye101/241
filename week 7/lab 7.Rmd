# LAB

Estimator qualities:

bias: E[$\hat{\psi}$] - $\psi$ : on average how far estimates are from true value.

Variance: $var[psi] - E[(\hat{\psi} - E[\hat{\psi}])^2]$: how wide sampling distribution/ spread out it is.

Confidence interval

plug in estimator = analytical analog to expectations

MSE = bias^2 + variance
